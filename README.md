# Life Expectancy Analysis and Modeling
The dataset is model by Linear Regression in Python with the package of [statsmodels.api](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)  
The dependent variable, y would be Life Expectancy. Furthermore,  
The project shows :
* how was the independent variables is choosed 
* how to get the best Linear Regression Model
* analysed on the perdiction interval with 95% confidence interval.
